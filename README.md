# Connect-Four-Game-with-AI-implentation-in C++
Four in a row is an age old game, mostly popular in 90’s at the time of the Gameboy. The kernel of our motive was to implement Artificial intelligence in the game, so that the computer can generate optimal moves for itself and use them in the game to give its opponent a fair fight. It is a very easy and fun game, all you have to do is match three of the chosen object in a sequential manner (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) to win the game. If the opponent matches earlier, he/she is declared as the winner of the game.In this project we tried to demonstrate the machine learning approach to generate optimal moves for the machine.This game uses save and search approach to generate moves i.e. it saves the game patterns every time it plays a match and uses those patterns to generate the moves in future. By analyzing the results of various matches, we have observed that the game gets harder as more it is played. Machine plays more optimally than the previous game it played. So we can easily interpret that the machine is actually learning from it’s previous experiences of playing and can engender optimal moves for ensuring a tough competition.
